This is a demo POC for generating idiomatic Chicory bindings from Wasm Modules.

This is just for demo purposes and covers only very limited cases at the moment.

The generated code is available in: `example/src/main/java/com/dylibso/chicory/generated`
The expected usage by the end user: `example/src/main/java/Example.java`
